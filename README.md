# Predict The Weather with Machine Learning: Beginner Project

This project demonstrates how to predict local weather using machine learning techniques. It's designed as a beginner-friendly tutorial that walks you through downloading weather data, preparing it for machine learning, and using a Ridge Regression model to make predictions.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will:
1. Download weather data
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Fill in missing values
4. Analyze weather data for insights
5. Train a Ridge Regression machine learning model
6. Evaluate the model's performance
7. Add additional features such as rolling means, monthly, and daily averages
8. Run diagnostics on the trained model

## Key Features

- **Languages**: Python
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning Model**: Ridge Regression

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found at the [Dataquest Project Repository](https://github.com/dataquestio/project-weather).

### Steps

1. **Download the Data**  
   The first step is to download the dataset from the Dataquest repository.

2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**  
   We'll use Pandas to load the dataset into a DataFrame, clean it, and handle missing values.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   After analyzing the data, we create additional features such as rolling means, and monthly and daily averages to improve the model.

4. **Model Training**  
   A Ridge Regression model is trained on the prepared dataset to predict the weather.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   We evaluate the model's performance using standard evaluation metrics and fine-tune it to improve accuracy.

6. **Prediction Function**  
   A function is created to make predictions based on the model.
